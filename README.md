## ‚ùì Interview Questions Answered
1. **WHERE vs HAVING**: WHERE filters rows before grouping; HAVING filters after GROUP BY.
2. **Types of JOINs**: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER.
3. **Avg Revenue/User**: `SELECT AVG(revenue) FROM users`
4. **Subqueries**: Nested queries inside `SELECT`, `FROM`, or `WHERE`.
5. **Optimize SQL**: Use indexes, avoid `SELECT *`, filter early, use EXPLAIN.
6. **View in SQL**: A saved SQL query, like a virtual table.
7. **Handle NULLs**: Use `IS NULL`, `COALESCE()`, or `IFNULL()`.
